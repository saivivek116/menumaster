2 web pages
1 -> main page for restaurants list
    a. header
    b. searchbar for searching restaurants
    c. list of restaurant cards with details like rating, name and some image
2 -> menu of a restaurant
    a. back button to go main page
    b. searchbar for search food items
    b. list of food items in cards with details like item name, image, price

keep it simple and clean code
no hungama
no complexities
only complexity is search bar we are not using async call so it should be fine we will just 
dont go to internal details
